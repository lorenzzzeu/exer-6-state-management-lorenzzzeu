# Exercise 6 - State Management
## Student Information
- **Name:** Lorenz G. Gabriel
- **Student Number:** 2022-04294
- **Section:** UV4L

## Application Description:
In this exercise, we are tasked to create a simple catalog of products with working Cart page and its Reset and Checkout button.

## Things you did in the code:
In the code, we were tasked to modify the lines of codes found in our laboratory handout. We needed to implement the Checkout button. I created first the Checkout dart file for its UI. Then, I implemented the pay function for it. I implemented the resetting of total value or total price and the list of items in the cart and make sure it will go back to the Catalog page after clicking the Pay Now button.

## Challenges when developing the application:
It is not that difficult to do this exercise. However, at first, I am a little bit confused on where to put what code on each file.
